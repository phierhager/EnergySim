# EnergySim

EnergySim is a modular simulation framework for energy systems, supporting core components, data management, thermal modeling, reinforcement learning, and utilities. The project is organized for extensibility and ease of use in research and development.

## Features
- Modular core components for energy system simulation
- Data management and transformation utilities
- Thermal modeling and state management
- Reinforcement learning environment and reward calculators
- Extensible architecture for local and remote components

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phierhager/EnergySim.git
cd EnergySim
pip install -e .
```
